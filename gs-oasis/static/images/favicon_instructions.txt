/* This is a placeholder. You need to convert the SVG to PNG with an image editor */
/* Since this environment doesn't support image generation, you'll need to:
   1. Open the favicon.svg file in an image editor or use an online converter
   2. Export/save as PNG with the name 'favicon.png'
   3. Place it in the same folder (/static/images/)
