            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>The message creates a sense of urgency, is vague about the details of the supposed problem with the user&#x27;s account, and prompts the user to click a link to verify their account, which are all common tactics used in scam messages. Additionally, there are no official logos, contact details or sign off indicating this is from a reputable source.</p>

            <h3>Educational Information</h3>
            <p>Always approach unsolicited messages or emails relating to banking details or verification with high suspicion. Scammers often attempt to invoke a sense of urgency in order to make the recipient act without thinking. Be wary of messages that lack specific information about what account or service they pertain to. Legitimate organizations will usually use your name in their communications, not vague terms such as &#x27;user&#x27;. Always confirm such messages by contacting the service provider directly through a verified number or email address, and never click on links or attachments in these messages as they may lead to phishing sites or download harmful software.</p>
