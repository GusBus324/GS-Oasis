            <h3>Educational Information</h3>
            <p>Most scams usually have some sort of urgency requesting personal identification information or financial details, utilizing fear tactics usually with dire consequences if not quickly adhered to. Always check for the sender&#x27;s details, email authenticity, grammatical errors and unprofessional language.
