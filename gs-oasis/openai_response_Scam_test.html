            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>The message definitely looks like a scam because it promotes an urgent action of clicking on a link that seems to not be from a trustworthy source. In most cases, legitimate institutions like banks will not send such emails to their users and will instead handle such matters through more secure channels.</p>

            <h3>Educational Information</h3>
            <p>To identify scams, look out for messages that instill a sense of urgency, request for personal information, include suspicious links, or come from illegitimate sources, among other red flags. In general, it&#x27;s best to not click on any links in suspicious messages and to contact the institution directly through its official website or contact number provided on their official channels.</p>
